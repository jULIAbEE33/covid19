## Project Overview

The purpose of my project is to pull Twitter data using the Twitter API and show whether or not there is a correlation between the hashtag &quot;Covid-19&quot; and the total number of confirmed cases in the same time period, state by state. The question essentially being asked is, &quot;do more cases of Covid-19 in location result in more tweets about Covid-19, in the same location?&quot;
